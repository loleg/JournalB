This repository provides templates and backend support for an online publication based on Newscoop 4.

The folder 'theme' contains all assets for the custom Journal B theme. The folders 'services' and 'controllers' has additional backend scripts we use on the site. Copy 'services' to the root folder in Newscoop, and the contents of 'controllers' into application/controllers.
